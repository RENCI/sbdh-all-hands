# Partnership Forum

*[The South Big Data Hub](https://southbigdatahub.org/)Â will host an invite-only Partnership Forum at the Sheraton Suites of Old Town Alexandria from April 18 - 19, 2024.*

Attendees will have the chance to discover new partners and funding opportunities while networking with big data influencers from industry, academia, nonprofits, and government.

The event includes three focused sessions --- clean energy manufacturing, health equity, and smart cities and the environment --- that will all feature the cross-cutting themes of education and workforce, and data sharing and cyberinfrastructure.

Registrants for this event should fall into one of two groups:
-   Those who can partner on behalf of their organization with other organizations to pursue funding opportunities in South Hub priority domains (Education + Workforce; Data Sharing and Cyberinfrastructure; Clean Energy and Manufacturing; Health Equity; and Smart Cities + the Environment).
-   Funding agency representatives interested in learning more about the South Hub community or speaking about potential funding opportunities.
