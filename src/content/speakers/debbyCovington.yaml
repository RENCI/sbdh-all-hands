  social work, and spiritual guidance. She leverages her multifaceted 
  experience to inspire and propel individuals, organizations, and

  As the Director of Strategic Partnerships and Equity Initiatives at the 
  University of Michigan College of Engineering, Dr. Covington spearheads 
  vital initiatives that nurture partnerships with minority-serving

  by offering workshops aimed at reducing anti-Black racism and fostering

  Services Framework for the Office of Student Affairs.


  Her dedication to leadership development led her to create VestedIn U,

  executive leadership coaching, emotional intelligence, cultural 
  intelligence, and applying DEI theory in real-world scenarios. 


  Dr. Covington has been an instrumental force behind the African American 
  Cultural and Historical Museum of Washtenaw County, where, as Board Chair, 
  she led the museum's transformation from a museum without a physical space 
  to a fully functional entity with a permanent location. Her efforts were 
  further acknowledged with a significant grant obtained in March 2024. She 
  also serves on the University of Michigan School of Social Work Alumni 
  Board, contributing to her alma mater's enduring legacy.


  She has a bachelor's degree in urban development from Michigan State 
  University, a Master's in Social Work from the University of Michigan, 
  and advanced theological degrees—a Master's in Practical Theology and a 
  Doctorate in Ministry from Ashland Theological Seminary. She also 
  completed an executive leadership coaching program from Georgetown 
  University's Transformational Leadership Program and is an Associate 
  Certified Coach through the International Coaching Federation. Dr. 
  Covington's life's work epitomizes a commitment to social progress, 
  educational excellence, and the transformative power of faith, culture 
  and the arts.
