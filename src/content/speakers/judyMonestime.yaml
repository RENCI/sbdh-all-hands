  Judy Monestime, DBA, MBA, RHIA, CPHI, is a research associate & instructor 
  in the Health Administration program at Florida Atlantic University (FAU).  
  She has a strong history of implementing health information technology 
  (health IT), such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and clinical coding 
  systems, to support healthcare decision-making in response to federal 
  policy changes.  Her lectures draw upon current research to highlight 
  real-world examples of how data is used to make informed decisions for 
  adopting health IT to promote health equity for underserved populations. 
  
  
  The impetus for this teaching and research emphasis began in her doctoral 
  studies when she discovered through qualitative interviews that providers 
  in community health clinics were less likely to use EHRs to optimize 
  patient outcomes. Her goal is to provide policymakers with recommendations 
  to enhance the utilization of EHRs in low-resourced clinical settings and, 
  in turn, increase the usage of socioeconomic and demographic variables in 
  these settings. 
  
  
  Dr. Monestime's research has been funded by the National Institutes of 
  Health (NIH) and intramural research awards from her institution. Her 
  research has been published in top-tier journals, including PLOS Digital 
  Health, The International Journal of Medical Informatics, and PLOS ONE. 
  Her scholarly contribution to health disparities research has been 
  recognized with several competitive and prestigious awards. As an NIH, 
  Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health 
  Equity and Researcher Diversity (AIM-AHEAD) Leadership Fellow, Dr. 
  Monestime plans to use machine learning to provide policymakers with 
  insights to increase health IT use in low-resourced provider settings to 
  address the emerging advance use “Digital Divide.”
